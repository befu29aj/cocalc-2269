  \frametitle{Analysis of Variance}
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a method of testing the
equality of three or more population means by analyzing sample
variances. One-way analysis of variance is used with data categorized
with one factor (or treatment), so there is one characteristic used to
separate the sample data into the different categories.

\bigskip

Consider the R Statistics code on the following page. It corresponds
to the narrative in Triola, page 562. The result is a test statistic
following the $F$-distribution and a $p$-value that can be compared to
the significance level. This type of ANOVA is always a right-hand
one-tailed test.

What is important to us is the test statistic, whose distribution is
the $F$-distribution, $3.8646$; and the $p$-value $0.0237$. Since
ANOVA is always one-tailed, area to the right, all you need to do is
compare the $p$-value to the significance level. ``If $p$ is low, the
NULL must go.''

  \frametitle{$F$-Distribution}
  The $F$-distribution depends on two different degrees of freedom,
  which makes using a table of critical values awkward. We will use
  $p$-values provided by technology instead. A
  table with critical values is here: {\footnotesize
    \texttt{http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda3673.htm}}.
  The shape of the $F$-distribution is similar to the shape of the
  $\chi^{2}$-distribution.

  \frametitle{ANOVA Exercise}
  Susan predicts that students will learn most effectively with a
  constant background sound, as opposed to an unpredictable sound
  or no sound at all. She randomly divides twenty-four students
  into three groups of eight. All students study a passage of text
  for 30 minutes. Those in group 1 study with background sound at
  a constant volume in the background. Those in group 2 study with
  noise that changes volume periodically. Those in group 3 study
  with no sound at all. After studying, all students take a 10
  point multiple choice test over the material. Test the
  appropriate null hypothesis using one-way ANOVA at a 0.05
  significance level.

    pays with a credit card?
  \item What is the probability that either three or four out of ten
    customers fill their tank and pay by credit card?

    fill their tank and pay by credit card?

  \frametitle{Final Exam Practice}
  {\ubung} A classic story involves four carpooling students who
  missed a test and gave as an excuse a flat tire. On the makeup test,
  the instructor asked the students to identify the particular tire
  that went flat. If they really didn't have a flat tire, would they
  be able to identify the same tire? The author asked 41 other
  students to identify the tire they would select. The results are
  listed in the following table (except for one student who selected
  the spare). Use a 0.05 significance level to test the author's claim
  that the results fit a uniform distribution. What does the result
  suggest about the ability of the four students to select the same
  tire when they really didn't have a flat?

  a recent February that had 28 days: Monday (114); Tuesday (152);
  Wednesday (160); Thursday (164); Friday (179); Saturday (196);

  the different days of the week have the same frequencies of police
  calls. Is there anything notable about the observed frequencies?
