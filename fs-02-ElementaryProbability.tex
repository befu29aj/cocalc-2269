  \frametitle{Definitions}
  \begin{description}
  \item[event] An event is any collection of results or outcomes of a
    procedure.
  \item[sample space] The sample space for a procedure consists of all
    possible simple events. That is, the sample space consists of all
    outcomes that cannot be broken down any further. The symbol for
    the sample space is $\Omega$. 
  \item[complement] The complement of event $A$ is $\urcorner{}A$ and
    consists of all outcomes in which $A$ does not occur.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Logic and Sets I}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item<1-> $A\vee{}B$ is the event ``either $A$ or $B$ happens.''
  \item<2-> $A\wedge{}B$ is the event ``both $A$ and $B$ happens.''
  \item<3-> $\urcorner{}A$ is the event ``$A$ does not happens.''
  \item<4-> $\Omega$ and $\emptyset$ are events; they are called
    `tautology' and `contradiction,' respectively.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Logic and Sets II}
  The logical statement $A\vee{}B$ corresponds to the union of sets
  $A\cup{}B$ if $A$ and $B$ are understood as sets of simple events.

\medskip

  The logical statement $A\wedge{}B$ corresponds to the intersection of sets
  $A\cap{}B$ if $A$ and $B$ are understood as sets of simple events.

\medskip

Events $A$ and $B$ are \alert{disjoint} (or \alert{mutually
  exclusive}) if they cannot occur together. In set theory, we can
express this by saying that they are disjoint if and only if
$A\cap{}B=\emptyset$.

Think of dice rolls as an example. $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Event $A$
may be $\{1,2,3\}$, and event $B$ may be $\{2,4,6\}$. What, then, are
events $A\cup{}B$ and $A\cap{}B$?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Definition of Probability}
Let $\Omega$ be a set of simple events. An event $A$ is then a subset
of $\Omega$. A function $P$ from the collection of all these subsets
(sometimes called the power set of $\Omega$) to the real numbers is a
\alert{probability function} if the following three conditions are
fulfilled.
\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> $P(A)\geq{}0$ for all events $A$.
\item<2-> $P(\Omega)=1$.
\item<3->
  $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)$
  for any collection of disjoint events $A,B$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Basic Theorems of Probability}
Here are some basic theorems that follow from the conditions.
\begin{block}{Rule of Complementary Events}
  $P(\urcorner{}A)=1-P(A)$\mbox{ for all events }A
\end{block}
This immediately implies that $P(\emptyset)=0$ since
$\emptyset=\urcorner\Omega$.
\begin{block}{Addition Rule}
  $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap{}B)$
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conditional Probability}
Conditional probability of $A$ conditional on $B$ is defined as follows,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:iekeengi}
  P(B|A)=\frac{P(A\cap{}B)}{P(A)}
\end{equation}
This theorem follows immediately,
\begin{block}{Multiplication Rule}
  $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)\cdot{}P(B|A)$
\end{block}
Two events $A$ and $B$ are \alert{independent} if and only if
$P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)\cdot{}P(B)$. Given the multiplication rule, this is
equivalent to saying that $P(A|B)=P(A)$ and $P(B|A)P(B)$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Rules}
  \begin{block}{Addition Rule}
    When $A$ and $B$ are \emph{disjoint}, then
    $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)$; otherwise use
    $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap{}B)$
\end{block}
\bigskip
\begin{block}{Multiplication Rule}
  When $A$ and $B$ are \emph{independent}, then
  $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)\cdot{}P(B)$; otherwise use
  $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A|B)\cdot{}P(B)$
\end{block}

\emph{without replacement}, what is the probability that they are both
defective?

  \frametitle{How to Solve Probability Problems}
In summary, here are some strategies to solve probability problems.
\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> Count simple events. If the simple events are all equally
  probable, then the probability of event $A$ is the number of simple
  events in $A$ divided by the total number of simple events, so
  $P(A)=\#A/\#\Omega$.
\item<2-> Make sure to watch for independence and mutual exclusion.
  Whenever events are independent or mutually exclusive (disjoint),
  you can use $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)P(B)$ or $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)$,
  respectively.
\item<3-> If events are not mutually exclusive, you can use the
  addition rule $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap{}B)$.
\item<4-> If events are not independent, you can use conditional
  probabilities in $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)P(B|A)$.
\item<5-> If you are dealing with events that are independent and
  mutually exclusive, it is often useful to draw a tree diagram.
