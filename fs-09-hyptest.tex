  \frametitle{Hypothesis Testing}
  What we have done so far is to make an inference about a statistic
  (proportion, mean, variance) based on a sample. Often, however,
  the method of science requires the reverse procedure: articulate a
  hypothesis and then test it to see if you can falsify it. For
  example, there may be a new medical treatment available or a new
  method of conserving a certain food item. A scientist then wants to
  test if the new method makes a difference compared to the old
  method. This is why for our next topic we will address what
  inferences we can make on the basis of two samples. First, we have
  to reverse our procedure and sort out what it means to articulate a
  hypothesis and then test it.

  \frametitle{Concepts of Hyothesis Testing}
  \begin{description}
  \item[Null Hypothesis] The null hypothesis is the statement that the
    value of a population parameter (such as a proportion, a mean, or
    a variance) is equal to some claimed value. Example: $p=0.5$.
    Decision: \alert{reject} or \alert{fail to reject}.
  \item[Alternative Hypothesis] The alternative hypothesis states that
    the null hypothesis is false. Examples: $p>0.5$ or $p<0.5$ or
    $p\neq{}0.5$. Decision: \alert{accept} or
    \alert{fail to accept}.
  \item[Test Statistic] The test statistic is a value used in making a
    decision about the null hypothesis. It is found by converting the
    sample statistic (the sample proportion $\hat{p}$, the sample mean
    $\bar{x}$, or the sample standard deviation $s$) to a score (such as
    $z$, $t$, or $\chi^{2}$) with the assumption that the null
    hypothesis is true.

  \begin{description}
  \item[Law] Republicans claimed in a lawsuit that a New Jersey county
    clerk did not use a required method of random selection when he
    chose a Democratic cadidate to be first on the ballot in 40 out of
    41 elections.
  \item[Genetics] The Genetics \& IVF Institute claims that its XSORT
    method allows couples to increase the probability of having a baby
    girl, and sample evidence consists of 879 girls among 945 couples
    treated with the XSORT method.
  \item[Health] It is often claimed that the mean body temperature is
    $98.6^{\circ}$F, and we can test that claim using the data
    provided earlier, which includes a sample of 106 body temperatures
    with a mean of $98.2^{\circ}$F.

  \frametitle{Examples II}
  \begin{description}
  \item[Business] A newspaper cites a \texttt{PriceGrabber.com} survey
    of 1631 subjects and claims that the majority of consumers have
    heard of the Kindle as an e-book reader.
  \item[Quality Control] When new equipment is used to manufacture
    temperature gauges for the food industry, the new gauges are
    better because the variation in the errors is reduced so that the
    readings are more consistent. In many industries, the quality of
    goods and services can often be improved by reducing variation.

  \frametitle{Hypothesis Testing: Procedure}
  \begin{description}
  \item[Step 1] Identify the null and the alternative hypothesis in
    symbolic form.
  \item[Step 2] Identify the statistic that is relevant to this test
    and determine its sampling distribution (normal, Student $t$, or
    chi-square).
  \item[Step 3] Use the $p$-value method or the critical value method
    to reject the null hypothesis or to fail to reject the null
    hypothesis.
  \end{description}

  \frametitle{Hypothesis Testing: Proportion}
  \beispiel{Gender XSORT Method} The Genetics \& IVF Institute claims
  that its XSORT method allows couples to increase the probability of
  having a baby girl, and sample evidence consists of 879 girls among
  945 couples treated with the XSORT method.

  The null hypothesis is ``the XSORT method makes no difference,''
  $p=0.5$; the alternative hypothesis is ``the XSORT method makes a
  difference and favours the birth of girls,'' $p>0.5$. This is a
  \alert{right-tailed test} (as opposed to a \alert{left-tailed test}
  or a \alert{two-tailed test}). Let's set the significance level at
  $1-\alpha=0.95$.

The test statistic for proportions is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bahhixie}
  z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}}=\frac{\frac{879}{945}-\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{879}{945}\cdot\frac{66}{945}}{945}}}=51.881
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Hypothesis Testing: Proportion}
The test statistic for proportions is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:aegaasee}
  z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}}=\frac{\frac{879}{945}-\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{879}{945}\cdot\frac{66}{945}}{945}}}=51.881
\end{equation}

You can see that this result is beyond the pale. There is (just about)
no way that 879 out of 945 births are girls if the true proportion for
the population is $p=0.5$. We reject the null hypothesis because
\begin{description}
\item[$p$-value method] $0.05\geq{}0+$, where $0+$ is the $p$-value for
  $z=51.881$.
\item[critical value method] $51.881\geq{}1.645$, where $1.645$ is the
  critical value for a significance level of $1-\alpha=0.95$ and a
  right-tailed test.
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The $p$-Value Approach}
  Insert a slide here explaining why sometimes the $p$-value approach
  is superior to the critical value approach (it gives an indication
  by how much the test was passed/failed). For a two-tailed test, the
  tail probability must be doubled to yield the $p$-value.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Type I and Type II Error}
  \begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./diagrams/error.jpg}
  \end{figure}
  The type I error is usually what we want to avoid (you may be
  sending an innocent person to jail). A type II error just calls for
  a more thorough investigation, for example an increase in the sample
  size. The \alert{significance level} $\alpha$ corresponds to a
  confidence level $1-\alpha$ and expresses a $1-\alpha$ confidence
  that the conclusion is not a type 1 error. You may remember the more
  serious type 1 errors by the mnemonic device \textsc{horn} ($H_{0}$
  is true, but reject null).
  % Mnemonic Device: HORN for type 1 error: HO true reject null.

  \frametitle{Hypothesis Testing: Proportion}
  {\ubung} An interesting and popular hypothesis is that individuals
  can temporarily postpone death to survive a major holiday or
  important event such as a birthday. In a study of this phenomenon,
  it was found that there were 6062 deaths in the week before
  Thanksgiving, and 5938 deaths the week after Thanksgiving (based on
  data from ``Holidays, Birthdays, and Postponement of Cancer Death.''
  by Young and Hade, Journal of the American Medical Association,
  Vol.\ 292, No.\ 24). If people can postpone death until after
  Thanksgiving, then the proportion of deaths in the week before
  should be less chan 0.5. Use a 0.05 significance level to test the
  claim that the proportion of deaths in the week before Thanksgiving
  is less than 0.5. Based on the result, does there appear to be any
  indication that people can temporarily postpone death to survive the
  Thanksgiving holiday?

Note: the functions on the last page can be modified to generate
random data. For example, \texttt{runif(100,3,5)} will produce 100
uniformly distributed values between 3 and 5. (If you want them
rounded, you can do \texttt{round(runif(100,2.5,5.5),0)}). Similarly,
the following functions will produce 100 values distributed according
to your specifications: \texttt{rbinom(100,12,0.2), rpois(100,1.7),
  rnorm(100), rnorm(100,197,15)}.
