\textbf{Term Test B Preparation}

{\prepprob} The mean number of patients admitted per day to the
emergency room of a small hospital is 2. If, on any given day, there
are only 3 beds available for new patients, what is the probability
that the hospital will not have enough beds to accommodate its newly
admitted patients?

{\prepprob} The number of accidents that occur at a busy intersection
is distributed with a mean of 3.4 per week. Find the probability of
the following events. (a) No accidents occur in one week. (b) 3 or
more accidents occur in a week. (c) One accident occurs today. 

{\prepprob} Use normal approximation to estimate the probability of
getting at least 57 girls in 100 births. Assume that boys and girls
are equally likely.

{\prepprob} Based upon past experience, 40\% of all customers at
Miller's Automotive Service Station pay for their purchases with a
credit card. If a random sample of three customers is selected, what
is the probability that (a) none pay with a credit card? (b) two pay
with a credit card? (c) at least two pay with a credit card? (d) not
more than two pay with a credit card? If a random sample of 200
customers is selected, what is the approximate probability that (e) at
least 75 pay with a credit card? (f) not more than 70 pay with a credit
card? (g) between 70 and 75 customers, inclusive, pay with a credit
card?

{\prepprob} Suppose a consultant was investigating the time it took
factory workers in an automobile plant to assemble a particular part
after the workers had been trained to perform the task using an
individual learning approach. The consultant determined that the time
in seconds to assemble the part for workers trained with this method
was normally distributed with a mean $\mu=75$ seconds and a standard
deviation $\sigma=6$ seconds.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected factory worker
  can assemble the part in under 75 seconds or in over 81 seconds?
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected factory worker
  can assemble the part in 69 to 81 seconds?
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected factory worker
  can assemble the part in under 62 seconds?
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected factory worker
  can assemble the part in 62 to 69 seconds?
\item How many seconds must elapse before 50\% of the factory workers
  assemble the part?
\item How many seconds must elapse before 10\% of the factory workers
  assemble the part?
\item What is the interquartile range (in seconds) expected for
  factory workers to assemble the part? (The interquartile range is
  the centre 50\%, i.e.\ such that one quarter of the workers is
  slower and one quarter of workers is faster than the workers in the
  interquartile range.)
\end{enumerate}

{\prepprob} Historically, 93\% of the deliveries of an overnight mail
service arrive before 10:30 the following morning. If random samples
of 500 deliveries are selected, what proportion of the samples will
have (a) between 93\% and 95\% of the deliveries arriving before 10:30
the following morning? (b) more than 95\% of the deliveries arriving
before 10:30 the following morning?

{\prepprob} According to the web site \texttt{www.torchmate.com},
``manhole covers must be a minimum of 22in in diameter, but can be as
much as 60in in diameter.'' Assume that a manhole is constructed to
have a circular opening with a diameter of 22 in. Men have shoulder
breadths that are normally distributed with a mean of 18.2in and a
standard deviation of 1.0in (based on data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey).
\begin{enumerate}
\item What percentage of men will fit into the manhole?
\item Assume that the Connecticut Light and Power company employs
  36 men who work in manholes. If 36 men are randomly selected, what
  is the probability that their mean shoulder breadth is less than
  18.5in?
\end{enumerate}

{\prepprob} Passengers died when a water taxi sank in Baltimore's
Inner Harbor. Men are typically heavier than women and children, so
when loading a water taxi, assume a worst-case scenario in which all
passengers are men. Assume that weights of men are normally
distributed with a mean of 182.9lb and a standard deviation of 40.8lb.
The water taxi that sank had a stated capacity of 25 passengers, and
the boat was rated for a load limit of 3500 lb.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Given that the water taxi that sank was rated for a load
    limit of 3500 lb, what is the mean weight of the passengers if the
    boat is filled to the stated capacity of 25 passengers?
  \item If the water taxi is filled with 25 randomly selected men,
    what is the probability that their mean weight exceeds the value?
  \item After the water taxi sank, the weight assumptions were
    revised so that the new capacity became 20 passengers. If the
    water taxi is filled with 20 randomly selected men, what is the
    probability that their mean weight exceeds 175lb, which is the
    maximum mean weight that does not cause the total load to exceed
    3500lb?
  \item Is the new capacity of 20 passengers safe?
  \end{enumerate}

{\prepprob} Loading M\&M Packages M\&M plain candies have a mean weight
  of 0.8565g and a standard deviation of 0.0518g. The M\&M candies
  used in a data set came from a package containing 465 candies, and
  the package label stated that the net weight is 396.9g. (If every
  package has 465 candies, the mean weight of the candies must exceed
  $396.9/465=0.8535g$ for the net contents to weigh at least 396.9g.)
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If 1 M\&M plain candy is randomly selected, find the
    probability that it weighs more than 0.8535g.
  \item If 465 M\&M plain candies are randomly selected, find the
    probability that their mean weight is at least 0.8535g.
  \item Given these results, does it seem that the Mars Company is
    providing M\&M consumers with the amount claimed on the label?
  \end{enumerate}

  {\prepprob} A ski gondola in Vail, Colorado, carries skiers to the top
  of a mountain. It bears a plaque stating that the maximum capacity
  is 12 people or 2004lb. That capacity will be exceeded if 12 people
  have weights with a mean greater than $2004/12=167$lb. Because men
  tend to weigh more than women, a worst-case scenario involves 12
  passengers who are all men. Assume that weights of men are normally
  distributed with a mean of 182.9 lb and a standard deviation of
  40.8lb.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the probability that if an individual man is randomly
    selected, his weight will be greater than 167lb.
  \item Find the probability that twelve randomly selected men
    will have a mean weight that is greater than 167lb (so that their
    total weight is greater than the gondola maximum capacity of
    2004lb).
  \item Does the gondola appear to have the correct weight limit?
    Why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}
