  {\ubung} Listed below are speeds (mi/h) measured from southbound
  traffic on 1-280 near Cupertino, California (based on data from
  SigAlert). This simple random sample was obtained at 3:30 p.m.
  on a weekday. Use a 0.05 significance level to test the claim
  that the sample is from a population with a mean that is less
  than the speed limit of 65 mi/h.

\begin{alltt}
speed<-c(62,61,61,57,61,54,59,58,59,69,60,67)
\end{alltt}
