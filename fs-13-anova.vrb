\frametitle{ANOVA Exercise}
  {\ubung} Copy and past the comma-separated value data (in cm) on the
  next slide. You have eight graduate students. They each measure the
  height of kindergarten children (six years of age, when there is no
  significant height difference between girls and boys). Can you rely
  on their measuring techniques to be consistent?
