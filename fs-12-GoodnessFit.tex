  \frametitle{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test}
  A while ago, we learned how to assess normality informally:
  \begin{description}
\item[Histogram] Construct a histogram. If the histogram departs
  dramatically from a bell shape, conclude that the data does not
  have a normal distribution.
\item[Outliers] Use a boxplot to identify outliers. If there is
  more than one outlier present, conclude that the data does not
  have a normal distribution.
\item[NQP] If the data passes the first two
  tests, use technology to generate a \alert{normal quantile
    plot}. The population is probably not normally distributed if
  either one of the following two conditions apply:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The points do not lie reasonably close to a straight line.
  \item The points show some systematic pattern that is not a
    straight-line pattern.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test}
  Now that we know how to do a hypothesis test, we can formalize these
  requirements. Consider a collection of data, for example the IQ test
  results on the following slide. Is the data normally distributed?
  Did another distribution generate the data? How good is the fit with
  a certain distribution? We will learn a goodness of fit procedure
  for \alert{categorical distributions} in a moment. First, however,
  we will have a look at the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which tests the
  goodness of fit with respect to a \alert{continuous distribution}.

  \frametitle{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test}
  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is the maximum by which the
  categorical distribution deviates from the continuous distribution
  to which we compare it.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test}
  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic has a complicated
  distribution. Software usually helps us to evaluate whether the null
  hypothesis passes the test.
  \begin{description}
  \item[null hypothesis] $H_{0}:$ the data set is generated by the
    continuous distribution under investigation, for example the
    standard normal distribution
  \item[alternative hypothesis] $H_{a}:$ the data set is not generated
    by the continuous distribution under investigation
  \end{description}
  If the IQ results are in the data set \texttt{iq}, then the command
  in R Statistics to perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is
\begin{alltt}
ks.test((iq-mean(iq))/sd(iq),pnorm)
\end{alltt}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test}
  Here is the output for the command on the last slide:
\begin{alltt}
ks.test((iq-mean(iq))/sd(iq),pnorm)  

	One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test  

data:  (iq - mean(iq))/sd(iq) 
D = 0.044518, p-value = 0.8229 
alternative hypothesis: two-sided  

Warning message: 
In ks.test((iq - mean(iq))/sd(iq), pnorm) : 
  ties should not be present for 
  the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
\end{alltt}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test}
  {\ubung} Apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test to find out if
  the following data sets are normally distributed. You can find the
  data on D2L in Lesson 7: Central Limit Theorem (when we learned how
  to assess normality using normal quantile plots).
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Ages of Oscar-Winning Actresses \texttt{OSCRF.TXT}
  \item Body Temperatures \texttt{BTEMP.TXT}
  \item White Blood Cell Counts for Males \texttt{MWHT.TXT}
  \item Flight Departure Delays \texttt{DPDLY.TXT}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Goodness of Fit}
  A \alert{goodness of fit} test is used to test the hypothesis
  that an observed frequency distribution fits (or conforms to)
  some claimed distribution. We now know how to apply the
  Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test for a continuous
  distribution. We will now learn how to apply a test for a
  categorical distribution. 

  \begin{description}
  \item[null hypothesis] $H_{0}:$ The frequency counts agree with the claimed
    distribution.
  \item[alternative hypothesis] $H_{a}:$ The frequency counts do not agree with the claimed
    distribution.

  The distribution of first digits is as follows:
  \begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|}\hline
   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 &  7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline
   52 & 28 & 20 & 18 & 8 & 9 & 11 & 7 &  9 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

  Now let's see if this is consistent with a uniform distribution.

  {\ubung} In soccer, serious fouls result in a penalty kick with one
  kicker and one defending goalkeeper. The table below summarizes

  % Penalty Kicks, by Bar-Eli et al. Journal of Economic Psychology,
  % Vol.\ 28, No.\ 5).
  In the table, jump direction indicates which way
  the goalkeeper jumped, where the kick direction is from the
  perspective of the goalkeeper. Use a 0.05 significance level to test
  the claim that the direction of the kick is independent of the
  direction of the goalkeeper jump. Do the results support the theory
  that because the kicks are so fast, goalkeepers have no time to
  react, so the directions of their jumps are independent of the
  directions of the kicks?
